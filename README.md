Houdini Asset Library

A collection of my configurations, galleries, setups, etc. for SideFX Houdini.

### Installation Snippets:

In your .env file:

`HOUDINI_PATH = $HURDFX;&`

```
HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH = $HURDFX/otls;@/otls 
HOUDINI_TOOLBAR_PATH = $HURDFX/toolbar;@/toolbar
HOUDINI_GALLERY_PATH = $MOPS/gallery;@/gallery
```

My first time using GitHub. Don't really know what I'm doing.
